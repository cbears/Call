This is some broken code showing how to use pjsua and pjlib.

What is it good for? Edit the python source and you can use it
to record a greeting. You need to replace the path to hello.wav
to a real file. Record your greeting as a 22.050 Khz Wav File. 

Earlier revisions show how one might use scipy.weave. 

To compile ealier revisions of this code, you need to compile PJLIB
on your machine with the -fPIC flag. to do that, set:

export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
export CPPFLAGS="-fPIC"

Once you have PJLIB compiled, you must set the path to PJLIB before
executing answer.py. To do that, set the PJPATH variable: 

export PJPATH="/path/to/pjproject"

You must also set the SIPHOST, SIPUSER, & SIPPASS variables.

You can reach me at bear@expression.com where expression should
be substituted with a term one might use when one encounters a
bear in your bedroom. Yikes!.
