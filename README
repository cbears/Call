This is some broken code showing how to use pjsua and pjlib. 

I used it to record greetings for my cell phone, though it may have
other uses? 

Overall, I feel that SIP is somewhat broken as a protocol, and pj*
approach towards SIP does nothing to address some of the core problems.

As to what the core problems are:

  * Routability. UDP does not work in many cases, especially when
    NAT is present. Proxies are not a solution.
  * Not mobile aware. If your IP/routing changes, your call is dropped.
    Although even worse, the person your talking to will not be aware
    that it was dropped until much later.
  * UDP packet ordering. Bursty networks (4g) wreak havoc on UDP. 
  * It is better to sacrifice real time voice for something that is 
    audible. TCP may actually be a better protocol?


Anyway, set the SIPHOST, SIPUSER, & SIPPASS variables to have it do something.
